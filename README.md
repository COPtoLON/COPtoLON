## 👋  Hi — I’m **Mark Brezina** (@COPtoLON)

Quantitative researcher & developer building **AI-driven, multi-horizon trading systems** and the tooling that supports them.  
My work blends market micro-structure modelling, reinforcement learning, stochastic calculus and rigorous risk management to squeeze insight out of noisy markets. 

## 📄 Research & Whitepapers
I believe in grounding practical applications in solid theory. Here are some of the frameworks I've developed:
- **Extended Geometric Information Framework Overview:** A conceptual model blending ideas from physics, differential geometry, and game theory to describe agents in dynamic environments.
- **A Full Market Dynamics Model (Draft):** A formal mathematical system for modeling market environments with hierarchical rules, time-varying graphs, and multi-layered geometric surfaces.

These will both be available under the **TMRW** repo within the next month(July/2025)

## 🚀 Pinned projects & what they do

| Repo | TL;DR |
|------|-------|
| **TMRW** | A research-grade framework that chains **Risk AI, Stat AI, Strategy AI (RL)** and **Forecast AI** pods from sub-second market-making to macro-thematic positioning. |
| **Knowledgebase** | 890-commit compendium of books, papers & notebooks across quant finance, insurance, maths and ML — currently being reorganised into step-by-step walkthroughs.  |
| **GoldenDice** | Micro toolkit that Monte-Carlo simulates Brownian, CIR and OU paths for pricing and stress-testing. Great sandbox for stochastic-process intuition.  |
| **QPM** | A collection of Jupyter notebooks that prototype mean–variance optimisation, actuarial cash-flows and other portfolio-math basics.  |
| **WTech** | Live-trading playground for a startup: state-detection logic, tactic selection and execution notes for medium-frequency crypto & equity strategies.  |

<sup>The Strategy AI layer leans on the classical Avellaneda–Stoikov market-making model for optimal bid/ask placement. </sup>  
<sup>Diagrams pulled straight from `TMRW/util` so they stay up-to-date with the code base. </sup>

## ✈️ Why “COP-to-LON”?

The handle is the IATA route I fly to visit my partner — Copenhagen  →  London.
